# LifeGame
A simple version of John Conway's Game of Life in Python using Pygame

I tried to code this as fast as possible to challenge myself. It turned out pretty well :)
Some tutorials on user input is needed, but other than that this project features
- Easy to understand grid system
- Game of Life mechanics
- User inputs:
  - User can toggle pause
  - User can toggle a single square alive or dead with a mouse click
  - User can speed up the simulation
